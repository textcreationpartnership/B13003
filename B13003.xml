            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>❧ A Proclamation for the speedy sending away of the Irish Beggers out of this Kingdome, into their owne Countrey, and for the suppressing and ordering of the English Rogues and Vagabonds, according to the Lawes.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas this Realme hath of late been pestered with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Irish Beggers, who liue here idlely and dangerously, and are of ill example to the Natiues of this Kingdome; And whereas the multitude of English Rogues &amp; Vagabonds doe much more abound then in former times, some wandring and begging vnder the colour of Souldiers and Mariners, others vnder the pretext of impotent persons, whereby they become a burden to the good people of the Land: All which hapneth by the neglect of the due execution of the Lawes formerly with great prouidence made, for reliefe of the true poore and indigent, and for the punishment of the sturdy Rogues and Vagabonds: For the reforming therefore of so great a mischiefe, and to preuent the many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which will ensue by the neglect thereof, The Kings most excellent Maiestie, by the aduise of his Priuie Counsell, and of his Iudges, doth straitly charge and command, that all the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme heeretofore made, and now standing in force for the punishment of Rogues and Vagabonds bee duely put in execution in euery part thereof; And more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, His Maiestie doth expresly charge and command, that all Irish Beggers which now are in any parts of this Kingdome wandring or begging, vnder what pretence soeuer, shall foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with depart this Realme, and returne into their owne Countrey, and there abide: And if any Irish man or woman, shall after the end of sixe weekes, to bee accounted from the date hereof, bee found wandering or begging, that then hee or shee shall bee apprehended, vsed, ordered, and punished as Rogues and Vagabonds, by the Lawes of this Realme, and then shall bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed from Constable to Constable vnto one of these Ports following, that is to say, <hi>Bristoll, Mynhead, Barstable, Chester, Lirepoole, Milford-Hauen,</hi> and <hi>Workington,</hi> or such of them as shall bee most conuenient for them; And if the number of those Irish in any one company shall growe too great to be so conueyed by Constables, that then they be conueyed from Sheriffe to Sheriffe vnto one of the Ports aforesayd.</p>
            <p>And His Maiestie doeth straitly charge and command, that no person after the end of the said sixe weekes, doe in any wise relieue those Irish Beggars, or any of them, which shall so wander or begge, and shall not apply themselues to be transported as aforesayd.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:185709:2"/>
            <p>And His Maiestie doeth further charge and command, that at the sayd Ports they be ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at the charge of that County and Port respectiuely, those Ports hauing beene the cause of this disorder, by permitting them to bee there landed, contrary to the Lawes, and that from thence, with the next winde and conuenient meanes, they bee transported and set on land on some part of that Kingdome of Ireland, there to bee disposed of according to the Lawes of that Kingdome: And that from henceforth no man be so hardie, as to conuey or bring into this Realme, any Irish person from that Kingdome, who is likely to bee a Beggar here, nor that any such bee suffered to Land in any Port of this Realme, vpon paine of such forfeitures and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, as by the Lawes of this Kingdome, or that Kingdome may bee inflicted vpon them for the same, and vpon such further paynes and punishments, as His Maiestie by his Prerogatiue Royall may inflict or impose vpon them. And if notwithstanding any such Irish shall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bee transported from thence hither, that vpon true enquiry made at what Port or place they were Landed, they shall with all speede bee sent backe thither to bee transported backe againe, at the charge of that Port and County where they were so Landed.</p>
            <p>And His Maiesty doth straitly charge and command all Shiriffes, Maiors, Iustices of peace, Customers. Comptrollers, Searchers, and all other His Maiesties Officers, Ministers, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Subiects, that they and euery of them in their seuerall places doe their best endeauours to obserue and performe His Maiesties Command in this behalfe.</p>
            <p>And His Maiestie doth further straitly charge and command, that if any borne within this Realme, shall hereafter wander and begge in this Kingdome, as Souldiers or Marmers, that they bee foorthwith apprehended and committed to the common Goale of that County where they shall bee apprehended; and bee proceeded against as Felons according to the Lawes.</p>
            <p>And His Maiestie doeth straitly charge and command all Shiriffes, Maiors, Iustices of Peace, Constables, Headborougs, Tithingmen and all other His Maiesties Officers, Ministers and Subiects whom it may concerne, that they vse all care and diligence to execute the Lawes against all Rogues and Vagabonds in that behalfe made and prouided, and now standing in force, as they will answere the neglect thereof at their vttermost perils, and that the Iustices of Peace of each County do vse their best endeauours to enquire out, and punish all such neglects and offences, and at euery Assizes to be held for that County, doe giue an exact and true account to the Iudges of Assize for that County, how, and in what manner they haue obserued the same.</p>
